742bcfd,2013-04-09T08:41:14,For --disable-mpi  we define COMM_WORLD as an int in libmesh_common.h  where for chicken-and-egg reasons it is difficult to include all of parallel.h.  Correspondingly  later things freak when trying to construct a Parallel::communicator from an int  as that constructor is not defined.  This implements that constructor.,0.0
