b56d8c1,2003-06-15T00:36:25,changed 2 to 2.  etc... for the hierarchic polynomials.  This was necessary for the Portland Group compiler.  There is still a linking problem,1.0
6afa87b,2003-06-24T05:33:51,added ParMETIS.  Need to actually code the partitioners.  Will do that soon.,0.0
bb994fa,2003-06-25T05:21:11,When linking with mpich  but NOT with petsc  made a small change to the library path in order to link with both -lmpich and -lpmpich  whereas before we just linked with -lmpich. The reason we need -lpmpich is that parmetis uses it I believe. Still need to make some changes to the parmetis Makefile in case both mpi and petsc are disabled.,0.0
55687dd,2003-06-25T06:01:05,Modified the configure scripts to automatically disable parmetis if both petsc and mpi were already disabled.  Also modified the parmetis Makefile to do nothing in case both petsc and mpi were both disabled.,0.0
f215447,2003-06-25T08:32:33,changed MPI configuration test to include the -I in the include variable.  This configuration should work well for MPICH.  Should we go to using mpiCC in the future?  I would rather not  but the MPI configuration section will need to be smarter...,0.0
2ab7453,2003-06-25T19:53:05,Completed the code for the LaplaceMeshSmoother class.  Note that this smoother makes no guarantee of being able to smooth grids on complex domains.  It implements the simplest possible algorithm for smoothing.,0.0
293b983,2003-06-25T19:58:26,Made the smooth() function pure virtual once again.,0.0
775db36,2003-06-26T07:16:29,changed not to !.  SGIs CC did not understand it...  Sorry John.  Maybe in the future?  It may be that a command line option fixes it  but I could not find anything in the manual page.  If you can find any information on the web we might be able to put it back in... Maybe you could ask Spencer?,0.0
36f77a5,2003-06-26T11:00:31,added fix to getpot.h for cygwin,1.0
877da3f,2003-07-05T09:59:14,"fixed funny bug: the PARMETIS_INCLUDE from PETSc's packages file could shadow the PARMETIS_INCLUDE from libMesh's Make.common... Perhaps the ""make"" I use is not the best  but at least this renamed variable does not hurt",1.0
83e66cf,2003-07-05T14:58:59,reworked the PointLocator structure.  PointLocator<T> disappeared  didn't make sense.  Instead  PointLocatorTree and PointLocatorList are there. But use PointLocatorList with CAUTION!  since this is primarily intended for locating the closest element  where the point may live in 3D  and the element  too  but the element is actually 2D (surface).  When applied to volumetric meshes (which is not truly intended)  it may happen that the centroid of an adjacent element is closer due to extremely distorted elements,0.0
6e4f0e4,2003-07-07T21:01:30,made MeshData and FrequencySystem a bit more usable,0.0

ec5287e,2003-07-10T07:38:06,the MeshData may now also take user-specified node/element data  not only reading from file.,0.0
0706b72,2003-07-10T12:10:10,hopefully final fix: a tricky call to SystemBase::clear() deleted EquationSystems parameters... Not desired when reading :-P,1.0
39e016b,2003-07-11T14:44:27,Added the magnitude of complex numbers when writing results in tecplot format format.,0.0
faee615,2003-07-12T14:02:59,yet another bugfix for MeshData: the good ol' 12.3456789D+01 issue  where the streams do not recognize the D as 10th-power... This fix is likely to be the last. :-P,1.0
fe8f940,2003-07-12T16:33:18,fixed the ::build_side() and ::side() for infinite cells.  the BoundaryMesh now works with infinite elements  too... yields cool pic's,1.0
c84df91,2003-07-12T16:56:39,moved the read_unv() and write_unv() methods from Mesh to MeshBase  so that a BoundaryMesh may now also be written as .unv,1.0
92862bb,2003-07-12T19:37:17,forgot to update the smart MeshBase::write(std::string) method,0.0
79cdaee,2003-07-12T20:39:30,fixed the MeshData to write a sensible header with the minimum info necessary for reading,1.0
1078f9d,2003-07-12T22:41:54,re-add the full MeshData support for xdr files...  This feature got lost with release of libMesh-0-4-0  now back again and working,1.0

ebeeb6e,2003-07-18T18:53:00,fixed a bug in assigning an end iterator to the beginning of a container,1.0
def48f1,2003-07-22T19:14:45,Moved a templated inlined function out of the C file and into the h file.  Funny to note that this compiled on gcc but not on xlC.  The main problem I think is the instantiation of templated *functions* as opposed to classes.  xlC wouldnt instantiate them correctly unless they were in the header file.,0.0
52d2d6a,2003-07-23T21:32:27,When checking the state of an ifstream  it is not correct to simply check if its !bad().  This is because the bad bit is not set when the file does not exist.  Instead the failbit is set.  Therefore it is more correct to check if the stream is good() e.g. assert(in.good()) rather than !bad().,1.0
177fccb,2003-07-23T21:49:05,"- John's bugfix for xlC was also the cure for HP-UX.  Thanks a lot  John! - fixed minor complaints about the ""this->"" issue",1.0
6f37c79,2003-07-24T18:31:17,Added some comments regarding the use of the read_xdr_soln and read_xdr_soln_binary functions.,0.0

d100bea,2003-07-25T20:58:24,consolidated several repeated methods in the partitioning algorithms,0.0
147f91b,2003-07-26T00:17:04,added a bool that lets the user decide whether she wants to prepare_for_use directly after reading a mesh  or do it by herself.  This is particularly helpful for IFEM simulations in parallel  first read the mesh  then let _every_ node build the IFEMs  and _then_ distribute.,0.0
9021b6c,2003-07-27T14:56:11,overly cautious: too many asserts.  Now the slim() method works,0.0

8639bf6,2003-07-30T16:14:05,"added the ""translate()"" method.  With this  nodal data stored in a MeshData can be translated to form that is suitable for the Mesh::write(...) methods  so that the nodal data can be visually inspected. Can translate either to the Mesh itself or to the BoundaryMesh",0.0

8904edf,2003-08-07T08:55:30,fixes for the FrequencySystem to work with only _one_ frequency-dependent matrix  instead of multiple frequency-independent matrices,1.0
b6e9175,2003-08-07T19:25:31,can now increase order of linear elements: added MeshBase::all_second_order()  tested for several  but not all elements.,0.0
dca0a6d,2003-08-08T09:13:24,fixed a dumb bug that added too many nodes that also gave me quite a headache with infinite elements.  Now this second_order converter works fine!,1.0
7dda254,2003-08-08T14:11:27,- extended the MeshData to compatible mode: when the  MeshData   was not active at mesh import time  one can still write   a Universal mesh  or read/write mesh data through the   compatibility mode.  However  be cautious with this mode    it uses the _current_ Mesh node and element ids - fixed MeshBase Universal support for Tet10,0.0

10ad7ea,2003-08-11T19:48:24,removed graph matrix support.  This is no longer necessary unless Damien REALLY wants it  and it causes unnecessary includes,0.0
c228d69,2003-08-12T17:49:18,- fixed meshtool for missing matrix graph - added functionality to write the boundary as Universal mesh    but with node numbers of the corresponding volume mesh - some more asserts in the MeshData,1.0

cb0111b,2003-08-16T17:33:49,some minor mod's to NewmarkSystem  and a fix.  matrices were assembled twice...,1.0
ebae48d,2003-08-16T21:19:30,the MeshData can now read also only a selected dataset 2414 (nodal/element data)  e.g. a .unv file that contains multiple load cases  one specific load case  identified through its label  can be selected,0.0

c72e6ec,2003-08-17T23:07:05,Universal files now write only the _active_ elements (in case you manually refined the mesh  so that you can write the refined only  without the leftover coarser elements),0.0
be07969,2003-08-18T14:12:44,changed the element flagging routines to exclude elements at the maximum allowable level of refinement from the statistics performed in the selection process,0.0
fc52d4f,2003-08-18T14:44:52,- thanks  John for the hint with the unsigned short int!  Reduced   mem requirements for the adjacent_vertices matrices of all higher-order   elements through converting to short int - reduced # of virtual fn's in Elem by one: the higher_order_equiv_elem()   or so got moved into a static member function of Elem.  This also enables   to choose whether one wants to convert quad4->quad8 or quad4->quad9   through a simple bool option in MeshBase::all_second_order(bool) - reduced repeated code in adjacent_vertices through moving these short   int matrices to Hex  Quad  Prism etc - fixed GMV support for higher-order Prisms (enuff debugging for today...  -),0.0

c61805f,2003-08-23T17:12:46,- minor fix to the logging behavior of the build_inf_elem() methods - MeshData can now also (for .unv files) transfer the _whole_ header   in one chunk  also tried to make the MeshData for .unv a bit more   idiot-proof -- i use it quite often right now,1.0

d02b42f,2003-08-26T22:58:45,The partitioners no longer modify the subdomain_id of the elements.  I suppose this could be put back if desired  but subdomain_id really refers to material properties  etc  NOT partitions. Also wrote (well Ben wrote) code to generate a submesh from a parent mesh.  One way this is useful is if you want to say create a new mesh consisting only of active elements  you simply pass two active_elem_iterators to the routine and it does the rest.,0.0
47da52c,2003-08-27T02:04:23,Commented out print commands and made a warning only print in debug mode.,0.0
0f4aa96,2003-08-27T02:07:25,Removed an extra pair of braces which didnt make sense.,0.0
cda314e,2003-08-27T02:51:33,Converted static_cast<unsigned int>(-1) to libMesh::invalid_uint everywhere.  Not much less to type  but the meaning should be much more clear.,0.0
404b8ad,2003-08-27T15:22:51,upp'ed 1-dimensional gaussian quadrature order significantly  but have to admit that i _computed_ the points and weights with double precision  so i already cut off the 15th digit  but even the 14th may be inaccurate (but at least close)...,0.0

30049a7,2003-08-27T18:55:52,changed configure to check gcc version from newest to oldest.  This allows gcc-3.3.1 to be properly detected as a 3.3-series compiler instead of improperly detected as a 3.1-series compiler.,0.0

839d995,2003-08-28T19:35:42,changed operator(i j) in the DenseMatrix to be non-virtual.  This was causing a matrix assembly bottleneck  particularly on bad compilers.  ditto for the DenseVector operator(i).  The functionality is replaced in the base class with the virtual el(i j) and el(i)  which must be used when the old virtual behavior is expected.,0.0

92adec8,2003-09-09T14:11:56,- reworked the MeshUnvInterface internals:  no need for a /tmp/xyz file   any more that buffers data.  This new method is something like   20%+ faster than the old one.  Tested on linux and hp-ux - added typedefs MeshData::const_node_data_iterator and   MeshData::const_node_data_iterator similar to the iterators for   the elements and nodes in MeshBase.  Convenient when one wants to   iterate directly over the nodes/elements with associated data  e.g.   Dirichlet-type boundary conditions.  Tested on linux and hp-ux,0.0
