ae2271a,2003-12-12T22:42:53,It is now possible to compute curvatures on element boundaries.  This information is available at the quadrature points via fe->get_curvatures().  This information is sometimes necessary for computing stresses on curved boundaries.  I have tested in in 3D (2D boundaries) and 2D (1D boundaries) and it appears to work.,0.0
9d444f7,2003-12-18T03:07:07,fixed a no-return statement condition,1.0
4ee00d5,2003-12-19T13:25:36,fixed a bug in the Plane class.  Thanks to Peter Kolb for this fix,1.0

d0b4dfd,2003-12-22T13:40:56,parallelized the nodal solution construction.  This particularly effects the writing of discontinuous data averaged to the nodes,0.0
112de30,2003-12-23T22:57:51,Made the constructor protected to prevent the possibility of users constructing this class.  It is only used internally by the mesh.,0.0
d9980c3,2003-12-24T00:30:43,fixed for Scali MPI compatibility.  Apparently MPI_SUM is not always valid for char data types,1.0
a309c4b,2004-01-03T15:37:44,initial rewrite of Systems classes.  The new solver interface will be much more flexible for complicated system arrangements  i.e. 2 systems  one implicit  one explicit  or 2 implicit systems  one linear  one nonlinear  etc...  More documentation and discussion on the developers list to come,0.0
e541d3c,2004-01-05T21:03:16,Updated the doxygen input file to also document the files in the new solvers directories.,0.0
9c6d3c4,2004-01-09T19:25:35,Added a new set of shape functions based on integrated Legendre polynomials. The new FEFamily SZABAB is simply named after the corresponding reference by Szabo and Babuska. Class FE<_dim  SZABAB> is only available through the FEBase::build method. Currently the shapes are implemented up to seventh order in 2D. Since some users may not be interested in higher order shape functions (and we will add more of them in the future)  these shapes are only available when the library is compiled with option pfem enabled.,0.0
d57285b,2004-01-09T19:33:22,Added new set of shape functions. Currently implemented up to seventh order in 2D.,0.0
64431a6,2004-01-11T15:56:46,fixed a bug in the solution projection that caused all vectors to be projected as parallel  distributed vectors regardless of initial distribution.  This causes a problem when the current_local_solution (a local vector) was projected  since it was improperly projected into a parallel vector.  I introduced this bug about a week ago in the system rewrite.,1.0
c4fb38a,2004-01-14T07:02:00,Added some links to TACC press release  USNCCM  and SAVIAC web sites.,0.0

d8be541,2004-02-09T18:40:19,Added html documentation for example 13. We still need to figure out why some of the system include files are being omitted from the documentation.,0.0
2d93b37,2004-02-09T18:51:31,Had to include libmesh_common.h in utility.h so that it would pass the test_headers.sh script.,0.0
