With such a scaling on linear hexs the XYZ is equivalent to a MONOMIAL basis  independently of the element size. On curved elements the approximation properties of this scaled XYZ should be better than MONOMIAL and should allow to go up to a third or fourth degree approximation without any trouble.""
