ea8f40c,2010-05-01T03:48:18,Gromacs trajectories fixes and improvements - FIXED: trr/xtc tests failed (on Mac OS X) when MDAnalysis was properly installed   as a egg directory but not as a developer install:   - forgot to include the trr and xtc files in the package   - learned that xdrfile_open() segfaults (at least Mac OS X) if     there is no file: added additional check to prevent that - Gromacs XDR reader now behave like DCDReader:   (1) raise IOError when done    (2) continue raising with repeated next() - for some reason  TRR files can (always??) return status exdrINT at end of file  catch   this in _read_next_timestep() - regenerated swig files from libxdrfile.i (only minor doc things),0.0
