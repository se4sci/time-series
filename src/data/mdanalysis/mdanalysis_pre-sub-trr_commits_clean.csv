54ed4b3,2010-10-08T13:55:34,Fixed bug 582 for compilation with C++ and additional fixes for compilation with c++.,1.0
7603305.0,2010-10-30T23:05:37,coordinate tests: make sure that for Gromacs tests the conversion flag is set correctly - set core.flags[convert_gromacs_lengths] explicitly in setUp - encountered failures (possibly when running multiple tests with --processes=8) which   came about because the conversion flag was set to False even though it should have   been True,0.0
b869469,2010-10-31T00:29:18,Trajectory API: clarified use of Writer write() method in response to Issue 49 - no code changes  only docs - Trajectory writers can take a Timestep as a rgument to write() - Frame writers only take a AtomGroup or a Universe for write(),0.0
2edbb91,2010-10-31T00:29:24,test datafiles: fixed import list CRD_small -> CRD,0.0
6ff313f,2010-10-31T00:29:34,Frame writer can take a Universe (fixes one half of Issue 49) - added universe attribute to Universe - altered GRO  CRD  and PrimitivePDB writer so that they can   deal with a Universe as argument (just get the coordinates from   the atoms instead of the 'selection' --- no performance penalty    just making use of the improved hierarchy and the fact that   .atoms is now a true AtomGroup) - added test case (passes),0.0
7129ae7,2010-11-01T22:10:11,use PrimitivePDBReader as default PDB reader - Bio.PDB's reader can drop atoms when they have the same name   in a residue (which happens for systems generated from MD simulations)   The PrimitivePDBReader copes just fine with thos cases (but does   not handle esoteric PDB features such as alternative atoms and   insertion codes that are not needed for handling MD simulation data). - The default behaviour of MDAnalysis can be set through the flag       MDAnalysis.core.flag['permissive_pdb_reader']   The default is True. - One can always manually select the PDB reader by providing the   permissive keyword to Universe  e.g. Universe(... permissive=False)   will read the input file with the Bio.PDB reader. This might be   useful when processing true Protein Databank PDB files.,0.0
9dd0cc7,2010-11-01T22:10:16,updated CHANGELOG with denniej's CRD additions (from http://code.google.com/p/mdanalysis/wiki/ReleaseNotes070 ),0.0

97e5ab6,2010-11-03T12:46:17,fixed race conditions in test suite - any tests that relied on values of the internal flags have been   changed so that they set behaviour through keyword arguments instead    of manipulating flags - affects gromacs conversion of length (GRO  XTC  TRR) with the convert_gromacs_length   flag and the use of the permissive PDB reader (permissive_pdb_reader flag) - tests could fail when they were performed in parallel and different test threads   changed the global flags - added a fes tests to check for the default values but DO NOT USE THE FLAGS during   testing,1.0

23a1bb7,2011-03-11T01:52:59,Support for PDBs with 4 character resnames and segID output when writing (PrimitivePDBWriter) (Issue 63  patch by dcaplan) - When I try to read and write PDBs with 4 character resnames used in NAMD/VMD I end up with an improperly formatted PDB file. This is also an issue with segIDs not being written. - I've made a quick patch where I add support for 4 character resnames and change the format string for the output to write the segID. I also added very simple support for better guessing of atom types since the function guess_atom_type was just returning 0. - I'm still not sure about how to deal with the 2 types of format strings for writing PDBs.,0.0

9ecb534,2011-03-21T18:12:57,new attributes for Atom: radius and bfactor - enhanced Atom object with the radius value (read by the PQR reader) and   added radii() to AtomGroup  this should make it easier to handle PQR files - changed the way that B-factors were stored: they are now also store with   each individual Atom. For compatibility with the old behaviour  AtomGroup.bfactors   is still a (managed) attribute but this will likely be changed to a method in   the 0.8 release to have a more uniform interface - Fixed a bug with the Bio.PDB reader: in the absence of a segid in the file it   would throw an error,0.0

0d37e3c,2011-04-09T22:34:05,patch for Issue 57 by jandom,1.0
d1ffce7,2011-04-09T22:34:12,fixed Issue 57: optimized patch and added test case - moved the coordinate check out of the loop and test the whole coordinate array in one   go (better performance but error reporting is worse because we do not report the offending   atom anymore) - remove the opened PDB file before raising the ValueError - added test case (should have had one for PrimitivePDBWriter anyway...),1.0
241afbf,2011-04-09T22:34:19,relaxed test for MDAnalysis.analysis.align.rmsd: rmsd(A B) == rmsd(B A) only has to be equal to 5 decimals (jandom reported some spurious test failures in Issue 57),0.0

f0b2076,2011-04-10T12:20:45,patch 57b by jandom: completes the fix of Issue 57 (coordinate checking of GRO/PDB writers) - From http://manual.gromacs.org/current/online/gro.html    - position (in nm  x y z in 3 columns  each 8 positions with 3 decimal places)    - velocity (in nm/ps (or km/s)  x y z in 3 columns  each 8 positions with 4 decimal places)   Does that mean a max values of 9999.999/-999.999 for coords and same for velocities  but with the decimal moved a digit to left? - added validation for gro writing  moved the coordinate checking method to parent writer class.,1.0
3ace9d4,2011-04-10T12:20:57,"test case for writing GRO files and optimization of fixes for Issue 57 - testing for writing GRO and limits ( -999.994 nm < x < 9999.994 nm ) - sharpened test for PDB limits ( -999.994 A < x < 9999.994 A)  note units A vs nm - conceivably we could include the boundaries into the legal values (they still round down)    if we do then we need to adjust the tests - legal coordinates check for GRO: moved out to before the file is even opened so we can get   rid of removing the opened file - GRO writer: use ""with open() as ..."" instead of ""try: ... finally: close()""",0.0
46cc00d,2011-04-10T13:05:51,changed legal coordinate values for GRO and PDB - limits -999.9995/9999.9995 - changed the actual check to min < x <= max (see Issue 57 comment #7) - tests: the min test is ok  the max test relies on <= and somehow does not   sharply discriminate  e.g. for GRO 9999.9996 passes and for PDB 9999.9951   passes. Not sure what's going on but I made the tests a little bit weaker   (PDB: 9999.996  GRO: 9999.999). In practice it probably won't matter...,0.0
0114e6a,2011-04-17T14:27:27,converted all TABs to spaces (Issue 69) - used emacs 'untabify' on all files  see   http://code.google.com/p/mdanalysis/issues/detail?id=69#c1 - unit tests pass - TODO: add marker lines for editors (do this together with a   fix for Issue 68),0.0
