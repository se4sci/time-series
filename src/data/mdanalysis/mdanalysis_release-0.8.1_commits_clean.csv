64c6eba,2014-02-22T18:01:54,Addition of new MDAnalysis.visualization.streamlines namespace.,0.0
e2dabb0,2014-02-22T19:07:41,MDAnalysis now correctly initializes the namespace for MDAnalysis.visualization. The 2D streamplot code in MDAnalysis.visualization.streamlines has been added and appears to function properly.,0.0
54b2860,2014-02-23T09:12:52,MDAnalysis.visualization.streamlines adjusted in the following ways: -an ImportError with appropriate message should now be raised when a non-standard dependency of this module is not available (rather than a print statement only) -the only non-standard (i.e.  outside of regular MDAnalysis) module requirement has been simplified to matplotlib.nxutils  and ideally this requirement will eventually be removed because it is a deprecated module of matplotlib (and also an analytical rather than plotting use of matplotlib) -the standard dependencies (MDAnalysis  multiprocessing  numpy  scipy) are now imported in separate statements for improved dependency sanity -a substantial amount of extraneous debugging code has been removed (although a bit more clean-up could likely still be done) -the placeholder main() function has been renamed to generate_streamlines() and the workflow may eventually be adjusted (perhaps encapsulated in a class),0.0
25afe78,2014-02-23T17:21:32,work on (sphinx) documentation for 2D streamplot visualization code: -mdanalysis/package/doc/sphinx/source/index.rst adjusted to include entry for visualization modules -new visualization_modules.rst entry and package/doc/sphinx/source/documentation_pages/visualization/streamlines.rst for pulling in 2D streamplot documentation automatically -major improvements to the documentation in and related to MDAnalysis.visualization.streamlines  including an inline example of usage / output plot,0.0

d79ca74,2014-02-27T15:53:52,-MDAnalysis.visualization namespace properly labelled as experimental in the CHANGELOG and Matthieu Chavent credited in authors list for most recent set of changes -Matthieu Chavent added to AUTHORS file and to authors list in documentation conf.py file -Changed the citation format for Chavent  Reddy et al. (2014) for consistency with MDA formatting standards -Python assertion statements in the 2D / 3D streamplot modules have been removed in cases where they perform type checking on user input  but they remain for algorithm-level integrity checks (i.e.  expected array shapes at different stages) -The 2D streamplot code now raises a more useful ImportError message when a user does not have matplotlib installed,0.0
c37ca71,2014-03-13T15:46:27,removed toplevel matplotlib imports,0.0
457bf8e,2014-03-18T14:47:11,MDAnalysis.visualization.streamlines_3D adjusted in the following ways: -the assessment of proper grid cube geometries is now less sensitive to floating point equality failure (assertion is now from numpy.testing.assert_almost_equal rather than a conventional equality test) -print statements for debug / progress monitoring have been suppressed (mostly deleted from source code) -the generate_streamlines_3d() function now accepts x y z Cartesian coordinate limits for the analysis instead of automatically calculating the limits of the system  this change is largely motivated by increased consistency with the 2D version of the code in MDAnalysis.visualization.streamlines.generate_streamlines(),0.0
257b2aa,2014-03-18T15:05:11,-updated docstring for MDAnalysis.visualization.streamlines_3D to include an example using the new coordinate boundary arguments -attempting a selective docs rebuild that only commits the modified pages/ images rather than full commit / push of mostly unchanged html pages,0.0
