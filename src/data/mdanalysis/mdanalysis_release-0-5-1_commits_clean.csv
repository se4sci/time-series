fb1c908,2008-01-31T11:53:36,Release tar ball.  - Change version to 0.5.0  (.0 signifies alpha status  later use a1  a2  b1  b2    after the patch version)  - Added MANIFEST.in to include doc files and all the necessary header files as they are    not automatically picked up by distutils (apparently  a bug: 'getting C library   sources currently broken--no get_source_files() method in build_clib.py')   Also need to pick up all pyrex files and the docs - Revamped docs a little bit. - NOTE: python setup.py install --prefix=mydir is not working properly  it still         tries to install something in the site-wide dir   Added links to googlecode and a template for acknowledgements. - Tested the sdist and managed to compile bot on MAc OS X and Linux (CentOS 4.2 with   modern numpy (> 1.0.3)) - updated CHANGELOG This corresponds to r94 in /code/MDAnalysis.,0.0
3e4db21,2008-02-01T22:51:16,Make PointSelection use the periodic flag in the same way as AroundSelection  even if it's no working properly at least it's consistent.,0.0
792533c,2008-02-10T23:55:26,* primitive PDB writer: only works if structure was read as a pdb. It   simply replaces the pdb coordinates with the time step coordinates.   For something more complicated we should have segment and residue   lists in MDAnalysis (perhaps save them when reading the psf). * added filename attribute to both DCDReader and PDBReader to make it   easier to write unified code. The other important methods and   attributes are already identically named.,0.0
b53c031,2008-02-10T23:59:51,Added bfactors property to the AtomGroup. It is only set when the structure is loaded from a PDB file. The bfactors array itself is an attribute of the Universe (because it makes no sense to attach it to the time step as it is only defined for a single frame) and handled as a managed attribute in AtomGroups. (Change where bfactors[] resides?),0.0
67d7a1a,2008-02-11T18:23:23,numpy.array only makes a copy if you force it. This should fix the problem with AtomGroup.coordinates() function and distance_array,0.0
4a76bae,2008-02-20T17:10:46,added reference in docs,0.0
1a7b735,2008-02-20T17:13:24,new attribute 'filename' (just initializes to 'dcdfilename') (also previously added to the PDBReader class): By having a common API for PDBReader and DCDReader on can more easily write code that can transparently use either.,0.0
49099c9,2008-02-20T17:19:37,Allow an empty AtomGroup (removed the check for length < 1) so that one can have intermediate selections that don't select anything. This can be useful in 'or'ed selections.,0.0
85b6118,2008-02-20T17:26:10,House keeping: - added generated files to svn:ignore - added a little bit to TODO and made sure that it gets into the tar ball,0.0
bf338f5,2008-02-25T00:43:35,"Issue #6: ""accessing coordinate functions of universe segments fails"" was caused by my previous skipping of the check for an empty AtomGroup. Reverted to previous version.",1.0
4bbbabf,2008-02-25T02:07:17,Added Ben's authorship.,0.0
b0b650e,2008-02-28T02:32:18,streamlined,0.0
0c907a8,2008-02-28T02:35:29,Universe: Convenience functionality for interactive work: if the dcd argument has a extension 'pdb' then we try to load it as a pdb. The dcd exception handling is not robust enough yet (e.g. segmentation faults occur when accessing self.dcd after erroneously loading a dcd) so we cannot do a simple try: load_dcd() ... except IOError.,0.0
2fb5875,2008-02-28T02:45:34,Fixed: check for dcd extension always failed,1.0
0e1f31a,2008-05-18T13:19:06,Added ID keyword,0.0
57a2bbb,2008-05-18T13:21:30,Universe now knows the filename of the psf file it was built from  dcd and pdb instances also have the filename attribute.,0.0
d70bb1c,2008-06-22T03:59:51,fixed: exception did not display psf file name,1.0
63e9b86,2008-06-22T04:07:02,* new water dipole correl time series: calculates the vector of   the dipole moment of a rigid 3-site water model * sanitized formatting of correl.h (sorry) * started using specific Exceptions instead of the generic one,0.0
37c0aa0,2008-07-01T21:52:54,Moved the distance array workaround into the function itself: we simply copy the arrays ourselves and all seems to be fine. For daring souls we provide copy=False and disclaim all responsibility.,0.0
2a09f62,2008-07-15T16:04:08,Only provide setup.cfg.template and let the user copy and modify it. This is better because otherwise local modifications mess up svn.,0.0
4dc0d3d,2008-08-23T00:36:29,Release 0.5.1: bugfixes and some enhancements that accrued over the last few months (see CHANGELOG for details). - LICENSE was updated with the UIUC Open Source License (catdcd code) - updated email addresses etc in README - updated TODO (distance_array bug fixed) - added keyword expansion for some of the doc files so that Id lines are   properly shown,0.0
