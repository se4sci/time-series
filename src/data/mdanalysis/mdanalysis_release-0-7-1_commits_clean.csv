97e5ab6,2010-11-03T12:46:17,fixed race conditions in test suite - any tests that relied on values of the internal flags have been   changed so that they set behaviour through keyword arguments instead    of manipulating flags - affects gromacs conversion of length (GRO  XTC  TRR) with the convert_gromacs_length   flag and the use of the permissive PDB reader (permissive_pdb_reader flag) - tests could fail when they were performed in parallel and different test threads   changed the global flags - added a fes tests to check for the default values but DO NOT USE THE FLAGS during   testing,1.0

4a637c2,2010-11-05T04:15:54,"documentation enhancements and configuration changes - added overview (not finished) and page on selections (goes beyond the current   online docs and includes the docs on instant selectors) - maded analysis modules separate pages (otherwise the analysis page becomes very   long and cluttered) - renamed the top level file to index because that makes it easier to serve it   via apache - configuration file changes     - bumped version/release     - put authors in one variable and also added Joe     - removed most of the special sphinx modules  only kept autodoc and intersphinx        add the others peicewise when needed (also might help to reduce weird sphinx       errors)     - added links for intersphinx (but commented out during development because       loading the objects.inv always takes a while)     - removed all path fiddling  simply use full import names in docs. This works well       but keep in mind that this obtains the docs from imported modules  works best       with developer installation (i.e. ""python setup.py develop"") - ""make html"" works fine for me",0.0

b2c933b,2011-02-01T17:09:12,work on Amber TRJ format - enhanced the Trajectory API: readers must be able to accept (and   ignore) any keywords.
