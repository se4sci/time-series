ee0da3c,12/11/15 17:39,MDAnalysis now truncates atom numbers when writing .gro files with more than 99 999 atoms  in a manner consistent with genbox in GROMACS 4.6.3. Note that it appears that some GROMACS utilities (i.e.  trjconv) actually write 00000 instead of 0 for the 100 000th atom. Both formats can be read in by MDAnalysis and VMD  and this is (overall) an improvement that allows us to write large .gro files in a workable manner. Fixes #550.,0
