Add support for lock-free and deterministic use of Random_XorShift*_Pool by giving state_idx selection and lock responsibility up to the application.  Done by an overload of get_state() to take sate_idx as an argument that the appplication guarantees is concurrently unique and within the range of num_states that the application passed to init(). In other words  this allows the RNG state to be associated with some application specific index  rather than a runtime arbitrary thread ID  and thus the application can control which work is performed using which RNG in a deterministic manner  regardless of which thread performs the work.,0
