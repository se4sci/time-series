ce2da50,2017-01-30 13:01:28,USER-DPD: renumber AIRs back to 1-7 for ghosts  and just 0 for locals. This removes the the distinction between pure and impure locals. Pure and impure locals messed up the directionality of half neighbor lists  which turns out is crucial to the approach for SSA with kokkos.,0
ee83b75,2017-01-30 14:32:18,USER-DPD: Split the SSA stencil and neighbor list into subphases. NOTE: pair evaluation order changes  causing numerical differences! This enables processing neighbors in subphase groups that enforce a geometrical seperation of pairs  allowing greater parallelism once fix_shardlow (SSA) is converted to Kokkos.,0

Add support for lock-free and deterministic use of Random_XorShift*_Pool by giving state_idx selection and lock responsibility up to the application.  Done by an overload of get_state() to take sate_idx as an argument that the appplication guarantees is concurrently unique and within the range of num_states that the application passed to init(). In other words  this allows the RNG state to be associated with some application specific index  rather than a runtime arbitrary thread ID  and thus the application can control which work is performed using which RNG in a deterministic manner  regardless of which thread performs the work.,0
